A menu-driven console application built in C++ to practice core programming concepts such as arrays, functions, references, and control flow.

This project is part of my C++ learning journey as I strengthen my understanding of foundational programming concepts.

**Features**

- Add tasks

- View all tasks

- Mark tasks as completed

- Delete tasks

- Count completed tasks

- Input validation

- Menu-based interaction

**Concepts Practiced**
-------------------------------------------

- Function decomposition

- Pass-by-reference

- Boolean arrays

- Control flow using switch and do-while

- Input handling with cin and getline

- Basic validation logic
