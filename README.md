This repository contains my C++ practice projects while studying core programming concepts.

The purpose of this repository is to build a strong foundation in C++ and gradually move from small exercises to structured, object-oriented mini-projects.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

**Current Focus**

- Functions  
- Arrays  
- Control flow  
- Sorting algorithms  
- Object-oriented programming  
- Dynamic memory management  
- Pointers and destructors  
- Problem-solving fundamentals  

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Structure:

Each project in this repository focuses on practicing specific programming concepts and improving code structure and clarity.

Projects range from basic algorithm exercises to small systems involving interacting classes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

**Learning Approach**

I am focusing on understanding:

- How memory works in C++  
- How constructors and destructors manage object lifetime  
- How pointers behave inside arrays and classes  
- How to maintain clean class design  
- How to break problems into logical steps  

--------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository will continue to grow as I progress into more advanced C++ topics.
